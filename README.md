Source:
This dataset is based on the famous Titanic passenger list from Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

This dataset contains passenger information from the Titanic disaster. It includes demographic details, ticket fares, travel class, and survival status. The dataset is commonly used for data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning practice.

#Visualizations Performed:
1. Scatter Plot
Purpose: Shows how passenger age varies across classes, separated by gender.
Insights: First-class passengers tend to be older; gender is visually distinct using colors, shapes, and sizes.

2. Pair Plot
Purpose: Displays relationships between multiple numerical variables.
Insights: Higher fare passengers and those in smaller family groups had higher survival chances.

3. Correlation Heatmap
Purpose: Shows the strength of relationships between numerical columns.
Insights:Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare (higher class â†’ higher fare).
Survival is moderately correlated with fare and passenger class.
